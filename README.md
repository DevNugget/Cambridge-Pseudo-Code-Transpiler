# Cambridge-Pseudo-Code-Transpiler
A transpiler to be able to run Cambridge's set pseudo-code language.  
**NOT AN OFFICIAL CAMBRIDGE DISTRIBUTION**  
This was solely made as a personal challenge and to create a helpful tool for my classmates that find it difficult to work with Pseudo-code, I came to the conclusion that it might be better if the code written can actually be executed to get a better understanding whether the code they write will return the expected outcome.
